# UWB distance contains the distance information measured by an ultra-wideband positioning system,
# such as Pozyx or NXP Rddrone.

uint64 	timestamp		# time since system start (microseconds)
uint32 	counter			# Number of Ranges since last Start of Ranging
uint32 	sessionid		# UWB SessionID
uint32 	time_offset		# Time between Ranging Rounds in ms
uint16 	mac			# MAC adress of Initiator

uint16 	status			# status feedback #
uint8 	nlos			# Visual line of sight yes/no
float32 test
float32 distance		# distance in m to the UWB receiver


#Angle of arrival, Angle in Degree -70..+70
float32 aoa_azimuth_dev	# Angle of arrival of first incomming RX msg
float32 aoa_elevation_dev	# Angle of arrival of first incomming RX msg
